Published by Exaltation Publications (LO.65-1972L). The Christmas story prompts us to a profound sense of awe and wonder. It is a love story conceived in the heart of a great and mighty God before the creation of time. The gospel of Luke records that after the shepherds had seen the newborn Messiah, they spread the word about what they had experienced. All who heard it were amazed! Even first-century witnesses stood in awe of this wondrous event . . . and the story continues to stir the hearts and minds of people who hear it afresh each year. Veteran composer/arranger, Tom Fettke, takes us again to Bethlehem to experience the fulfillment of God&amp;apos;s plan in a humble manger. Beloved and familiar carols along with new texts and melodies are masterfully blended to create a Christmas worship experience as again we are invited to celebrate the great and mighty wonder of God&amp;apos;s love! (Although conceived without a spoken narrative, one is provided as a performance option. ) (Limit one per church).",1022333,000308104486,1022333.jpg

There are brief monologues for ten characters--ranging from Mary and Joseph to members of the Innkeeper's family--interspersed among the seven songs. (Also included are character descriptions, set and staging suggestions, and hints for wardrobe and props). The music is Ruth Elaine Schram at her best: beautiful melodies, thoughtful texts, well-crafted part writing-and includes familiar carols with possible congregational participation. The optional orchestration demands are modest, making it possible for the use of live instruments even on a limited budget. An Accompaniment CD is also available, if desired. &quot;The Living Light&quot; is flexible and accessible enough to appeal to and be within the capabilities of most music ministry programs. / Cantata/Sacred Musical / SATB, Piano / Optional Orchestra, Accompaniment CD, Performance CD / Christmas",1050588,9780893287320,1050588.jpg
